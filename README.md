WebFontTailor
=============

A library to automatically manage families of web fonts.

As an example, the [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) font family is composed of many font files. There are specific font files for different combinations of 
* weights 
* regular vs italic/oblique
* serif vs sans
* hinted vs unhinted
* different languages
* individual vs groups of languages

As of Oct. 14, 2014 there are already over 300 font files in the Noto family.
